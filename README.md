# Google-Sheets-mimicking
A JavaScript-based web application mimicking the core functionalities and UI of Google Sheets, featuring mathematical and data quality functions.

Project Title:
Google Sheets Clone

Description:
This project is a web-based spreadsheet application inspired by Google Sheets. It offers a familiar UI and core functionalities, such as mathematical calculations, data quality functions, data entry validation, and interactive user interfaces.

Key Features:
Spreadsheet Interface

Google Sheets-like UI with a formula bar, toolbar, and grid.

Cell formatting: Bold, italic, font size, color.

Add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

Drag-and-drop support for content and formulas.

Mathematical Functions:

SUM: Calculates the sum of selected cells.

AVERAGE: Computes the average of selected cells.

MAX: Finds the maximum value in a range.

MIN: Finds the minimum value in a range.

COUNT: Counts numerical values in a range.

Data Quality Functions:

TRIM: Removes extra spaces.

UPPER: Converts text to uppercase.

LOWER: Converts text to lowercase.

REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Eliminates duplicate entries in a range.

FIND_AND_REPLACE: Search and replace text within cells.

Data Entry and Validation:

Supports text, numbers, and dates.
